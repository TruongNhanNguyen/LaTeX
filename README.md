### Quick $\LaTeX$ overview

#### What is $\LaTeX$

> **LaTeX – A document preparation system**

LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software.

You don't have to pay for using LaTeX, i.e., there are no license fees, etc. But you are, of course, invited to support the maintenance and development efforts through a donation to the TeX Users Group (choose LaTeX Project contribution) if you are satisfied with LaTeX.

You can also sponsor the work of LaTeX team members through the GitHub sponsor program at the moment for Frank, David and Joseph. Your contribution will be matched by GitHub in the first year and goes 100% to the developers.

For more information, you can visit this website [$\LaTeX$_project.org](https://www.latex-project.org/)

#### $\LaTeX$ installation

> To write $\LaTeX$ documents, you are free having two choices where and which software you should use.

1. Online $\LaTeX$ editor such as:

    One of the best online $\LaTeX$ editor for you is **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)**. To use it, use have to create an account in which you can save your projects and publish to [Github](https://github.com/). And another benefit from using **Overleaf** is that you can explore a large template repository for creating $\LaTeX$ documents, it is various so you can learn every thing you need.
2. Offline $\LaTeX$ editor:

    To typeset $\LaTeX$ documents on your computer, you have to install some required components for $\LaTeX$ , include:

    - $\LaTeX$ distribution such as **[TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)**, **[MikTeX](https://miktex.org/)** (for Window or MacOs). If you are working on MacOS, you may be not have to install any thing because MacOs will provide TexMac and TexPad for you.

    - $\LaTeX$ editors are so various from **[TeXMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)**, **[TeXStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)**, these are text editor for unique purpose (create $\LaTeX$ source files) to multi purpose text editor like **[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)** , **[Atom](https://atom.io/)** and **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and even **[NeoVim](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.

    - $\LaTeX$ compiler, it is provided along with $\LaTeX$ distributions.

## My Installation

I use **Visual Studio Code** to write $\LaTeX$ documents. So i will share you my **vscode** set up for $\LaTeX$:

1. Install **TeXLive** (latest. version is **TeXLive** 2021)

2. Install **[$\LaTeX$ workshop extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)** for **Visual Studio Code** from the **VSCode Marketplace** or directly install from **VSCode extensions** by press `Ctrl + Shift + X`, type **$\LaTeX$ workshop**, then just click `install`. Or use `Ctrl + P` and type `ext install Jame-Yu.latex-workshop`.

3. Then, open the editor, create new file and save with name `<name>.tex` and begin your typesetting.

## Overview

This repository includes **Tikz** pictures for my documents, **pdfLaTeX** files and $\LaTeX$ source code files.

I often clone pictures from **[TeXample.net](https://texample.net/)** and remake them for my purpose.

Some of my $\LaTeX$ documents are written online by using **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)**.
