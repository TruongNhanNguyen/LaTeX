### Quick **LaTeX** overview

#### What is **LaTeX**

> **LaTeX – A document preparation system**

**LaTeX** is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. **LaTeX** is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. **LaTeX** is available as free software.

You don't have to pay for using **LaTeX**, i.e., there are no license fees, etc. But you are, of course, invited to support the maintenance and development efforts through a donation to the TeX Users Group (choose **LaTeX** Project contribution) if you are satisfied with **LaTeX**.

You can also sponsor the work of **LaTeX** team members through the **GitHub** sponsor program at the moment for **Frank**, **David** and **Joseph**. Your contribution will be matched by **GitHub** in the first year and goes **100%** to the developers.

## Overview

This repository includes **Tikz** pictures for my documents, **pdfLaTeX** files and LaTeX source code files.

I often clone pictures from **[TeXample.net](https://texample.net/)** and remake them for my purpose.

Some of my **LaTeX** documents are written online by using [![Overleaf](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Overleaf-000000?style=flat&logo=overleaf&logoColor=ffffff&labelColor=258337)](https://www.overleaf.com/).
